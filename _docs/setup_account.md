# Setup Account

Setup is done entirely via the [integration UI](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=harvest_time_tracker).

You will need a [Harvest Personal Access Token](https://id.getharvest.com/oauth2/access_tokens/new).

You can do this for as many accounts as you would like.
